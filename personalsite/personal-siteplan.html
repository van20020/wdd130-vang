        <p>The BYU-I classroom technology team is here to help the classrooms run smoothly and help when issues arise. You may have seen us around, we're the ones who come into your classrooms and fix things when they break, from the PC to the projectors. We fix many problems that come up when classrooms are in use. Problems we run into range from audio issues, keyboard and mouse issues, projector issues, airmedia issues, PC issues, as well as so much more. Here you can learn about some simple things you can do in any of our classrooms to fix issues as they arise. You can't fix everything, but there are a few things you are able to do to help yourself and others. You can also learn about the many awesome technicianns we have working here, and see that we are more than just a bunch of nerds. </p>

        Content for Basic Troubleshooting
        •	Problems with Projector
        •	Problems with Sound
        •	Problems with Computer
        •	Problems with Zoom
      <p>Here you can learn about the many common issues which plague our classrooms here at BYU-I. We'll show you how you can better identify certain problems, and what you can do to potentially fix them. There are still quite a few issues which only classroom technology can fix, since we have keys to access the more sensitive equipment. But you'd be surprised at how many problems you can fix with some of these simple solutions. While we're at it, we'll mention some of our special case rooms, or as we like to call them "cursed" rooms. These are rooms that are set up in a different way to other normal classrooms. All you really need to know is these rooms are evil, and even we struggle to get them fixed.</p>

      <p>Here we will introduce you to our team, the many wonderful people who work here, and let you get to know them. We have had many different people come through classroom tech over the years, and I'm sure there will be many more. This will be the place to stay up to date with who is currently working here, and even have a memorial for those who have left.</p>
