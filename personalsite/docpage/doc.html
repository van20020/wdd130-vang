        <p>DMPS 150</p>
        <p> 
            The DMPS-150 series is the main DMPS used in "Standard Classrooms." The main inputs to remember
        on a 150 are the "HDMI" ports, "Audio Out" port, "LAN" port, and "DM Out" port. The DMPS recieves
        power through a "D-Power Supply" and is the main controller for a classroom system. <br>
            There are usually three inputs in the HDMI ports on a 150. "HDMI 2" is connected via HDMI to the
        Airmedia. "HDMI 3" uses a longer HDMI cable that extends out of the podium, and is used for an external
        HDMI that is able to connect a laptop or other devices that have an HDMI port. "HDMI 4" is connected to 
        via HDMI to the computer. <br>
            Audio is controled via a speaker cable with a "RCA" end connecting to a Labgruppen Amp and a "Phoenix 
        Head" connecting to the "Audio Out" port. The speaker wire is stripped to reveal the red, black, and ground
        wire which are then put into the "Phoenix Head" to connect to the DMPS. The red wire will go into the 
        "+" socket, the black wire will go into the "-" socket, and the ground wire will go into the "G" socket.
        Once connected, the devices that are connected to the DMPS should have a "Crestron" option as a audio 
        output. <br>
            Both the "LAN" and "DM Out" options will use a "Network/DM" cable or wire. "DM Out" will connect into 
        the "DM Out" port on the DMPS and connect to a projector's "Digital Link" port. The "DM Out" via 
        a "Network Cable" will send an IP address to the connecting projector. Be careful not to plug this
        cable in to a projector's "LAN" port as this will not send an IP address. <br>
            The "LAN" option will connect from the DMPS to the "B" port in a Network box commonly found 
        in the podium. <br>
            The "VGA" ports are outdated and are no longer in use by Classroom Technology. Occasionally, an
        "AUX" cord will be plugged into the "Audio" ports found next to the VGA ports and are used as an external
        audio option in special classrooms.

        <p>DMPS 300</p>
        <p> 
            A DMPS-300 or DMPS-350 series will have most of the same connections as a DMPS-150 series. However,
        because of the added ports on a DMPS-300 and DMPS-350 series, they are more commonly used in "Combinable
        Rooms" rather than "Standard Rooms." Information on these rooms will be added to the bottom of the page
        labeled "Specialty Rooms." Any information recording how to hook up a DMPS-300 as a "Standard Classroom"
        can be refered back to the DMPS-150. <br>

        <p>Panasonic Projector | VMZ60</p>
        <p>
            The "VMZ60" model of Panasonic projectors are the most commonly found projectors found in classrooms.
        They are powered via a "D-Power Supply" and the only ports used by Classroom Technology are the "LAN" 
        and "Digital Link" ports. <br>
            The only wires plugged in to a projector are "Network Wires" with one always going to the "Digital
        Link" and another occasionally going to the "LAN." A "Network Wire" is connected to the "Digital Link"
        port and goes into a DMPS's "DM Out" port. This provides an image from the DMPS to be sent to the 
        projector. <br>
            The "LAN" port is only plugged in to if the projector itself needs an IP address or network connection.
        This is usually used only for "Second" or "Rear-facing" projectors since they do not receive an IP
        address through the "DM Out" like the main projectors do and are not part of "Standard Rooms."<br>
            The IP address is used to "Point" the projector to the DMPS. Find the IP address by accessing the
        "Menu" of a projector and locating the "Network Settings" tab. Once you have the IP address, connect
        to a computer that has access to the Classroom Technology Idrive and open up "Current Production 
        Files". Next, open the "Crestron Connected Setup" file and click "File" on the top left of the
        program and choose to select a program. Select the correct DMPS model and once the program loads
        click "Options" next to the "Files" tab and choose "Host Settings." From here, you can put in the 
        IP address of the projector, correct IPID which is usually 3, and 41794. If done correctly, the program
        will connect to the projector and the IP address of the DMPS can be put in to the information followed
        by the correct IPID, and 41794. If done correctly, the TouchPanel will have a red dot on the "Pic On"
        and "Pic Off" options, and will have the ability to turn off and on the projector. For any additional
        information, visit the Main Documentation.

    <p>Epson Projector | L1200</p>
    <p>
        The L1200 model Epson projectors are similar to Pananic projectors. They require a "D-Power Supply"
    and the only ports used for these projectors are also the "Digital Link" and "LAN" ports. Connections of 
    these ports can be found in the Panasonic projector information. These projectors have a lens and are 
    usually used in rooms that require to project from a longer distance.

    <img src="../siteplan/images/Labgruppen AMP.png">
        <p>Labgruppen Amplifier</p>
        <p> 
            The Labgruppen Amplifier or simply an "amp" are the most common amplifiers used in "Standard Classrooms."
        These amps also use a "D-Power Supply" to power the device. The "Speaker Inputs" and "Balanced 
        Speaker Outputs" are the main ports on this device. <br>
            Two seperate speaker wires are used to connect the amp to the "Speakers" and to the "DMPS." The 
        "RCA" end of one of these wires will connectto the "Speaker Inputs" with red going to "+", 
        negative to "-", and ground to "G" for one of the ports. Speaker wires will also connect via a 
        larger "Phoenix Head" into the "Balanced Speaker Outputs" which will run to each speaker. They will
        be connected red to "+", black to "-", and ground to "G" once again. <br>
            If audio is either too quiet or having other issues, the nobs labeled "Channel" may also be 
        adjusted.

        <p>TouchPanels</p>
        <p>
            Classroom Technology uses three different model TouchPanels in their classrooms, but most 
        function the same. They are connected with solely a "Network Cable" attached to the back of the 
        device and go in to "Port D" in a "Network Box" in the podium. This gives the TouchPanel both power
        through "POE" or "Power Over Ethernet" and network or an IP address. <br>
            The "Secret Menu" for these TouchPanels are commonly opened by pressing the first four buttons
        on the right of the TouchPanel repeatedly until the device UI changes. From here, the TouchPanel
        can be named and "Pointed" to the DMPS for functionality. <br>
            To "Point" a TouchPanel to a DMPS, open "Ethernet Connections" and put in the IP address or hostname
        of the DMPS into one of the options that appear. Once you exit, the UI should change to the UI used
        in classrooms and the TouchPanel will control the system.

        <p>Special Equipment</p>
        <p> 
            Specialty Rooms are less common than Standard Rooms and require DMPS's to have special
        programs. All "Combinable" classrooms will have a DMPS-300 which have additional connections to 
        connect audio, video, and other functionalities for both rooms to work combined and independently 
        of each other. For a more detailed explanation of how these rooms are routed, consult the Main 
        Documentation. <br>
            Here is a list of equipment that can be found in non-standard rooms. It includes: RDLs and ceiling
        mics, TeachLogics, BiAmps, Jade Remotes, short-throw projectors, document cameras, Zoom cameras, 
        wall sensors, Bluetooth connection devices, and wall-amps. For more information about these types
        of equipment, consult the Main Documentation.
