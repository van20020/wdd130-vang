    <p> My major is CIT with a minor in Automotive and I've been attending
        BYU Idaho for about 2 and a half years. I've been married for nearly
        a year now, and I enjoy playing different sports like volleyball and 
        football.</p>
    <p> An interesting fact about me is that I'm Hmong. The "H" is silent so
        its pronounced "Mong." Hmong people orginate from Southeast Asia,
        but I was born in Minnesota and grew up in California. I now spend
        my time in Idaho since my wife is from here, and I enjoy the cold and 
        snow very much.</p>
